This includes in particular the Law on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act &#8211; BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions on the right to access, the right to erase, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference to the applicability of the GDPR and the Swiss DPA: <\/strong>These privacy notices serve both to provide information in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (Swiss DPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"m27\">Security Precautions<\/h2>\n<p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.<\/p>\n<p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects&#8217; rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and service providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"m25\">Transmission of Personal Data<\/h2>\n<p>In the context of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to other places, companies or persons or that it is disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are embedded in a website. In such cases, the legal requirements will be respected and in particular corresponding contracts or agreements, which serve the protection of your data, will be concluded with the recipients of your data.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"m10\">Rights of Data Subjects<\/h2>\n<p>Rights of the Data Subjects under the GDPR: As data subject, you are entitled to various rights under the GDPR, which arise in particular from Articles 15 to 21 of the GDPR:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Right to Object: You have the right, on grounds arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of your personal data which is based on letter (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions.

For example, to store the login status in a user account, the contents of a shopping cart in an e-shop, the contents accessed or the functions used. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, e.g. for purposes of functionality, security and convenience of online offers as well as the creation of analyses of visitor flows.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Information on consent: <\/strong>We use cookies in accordance with the statutory provisions. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users, except when it is not required by law. In particular, consent is not required if the storage and reading of information, including cookies, is strictly necessary in order to provide an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user. Essential cookies usually include cookies with functions related to the display and operability of the onlineservice, load balancing, security, storage of users&#8217; preferences and choices or similar purposes related to the provision of the main and secondary functions of the onlineservice requested by users. The revocable consent will be clearly communicated to the user and will contain the information on the respective cookie use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Information on legal bases under data protection law: <\/strong>The legal basis under data protection law on which we process users&#8217; personal data with the use of cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis for processing their data is their declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online services and improvement of its usability) or, if this is done in the context of the fulfillment of our contractual obligations, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations. For which purposes the cookies are processed by us, we do clarify in the course of this privacy policy or in the context of our consent and processing procedures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Retention period:<\/strong> With regard to the retention period, a distinction is drawn between the following types of cookies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Temporary cookies (also known as &#8220;session cookies&#8221;):<\/strong> Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online service and closed his or her end device (i.e. browser or mobile application).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Permanent cookies<\/strong>: Permanent cookies remain stored even after the terminal device is closed. For example, the login status can be saved, or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. Likewise, user data collected with the help of cookies can be used for reach measurement. Unless we provide users with explicit information about the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g., as part of obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and that the storage period can be up to two years.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>General notes on revocation and objection (so-called &#8220;Opt-Out&#8221;): <\/strong>Users can revoke the consents they have given at any time and object to the processing in accordance with legal requirements. Users can restrict the use of cookies in their browser settings, among other options (although this may also limit the functionality of our online offering). A objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be made through the websites <a href=\"https:\/\/optout.aboutads.info\/\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/optout.aboutads.info<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youronlinechoices.com\/\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.youronlinechoices.com\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"m-elements\">\n<li class=\"\"><strong>Legal Basis:<\/strong> Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).

The scope of the processing depends, on the one hand, on which data is requested in the context of a specific Conference (e.g., provision of access data or clear names) and which optional information is provided by the participants. In addition to processing for the purpose of conducting the conference, participants&#8217; Data may also be processed by the Conference Platforms for security purposes or service optimization.

The data will be transmitted to us encrypted according to the state of the art. Applicants can also send us their applications by e-mail. Please note, however, that e-mails on the Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted during transport, but not on the servers from which they are sent and received. We can therefore accept no responsibility for the transmission path of the application between the sender and the reception on our server. For the purposes of searching for applicants, submitting applications and selecting applicants, we may make use of the applicant management and recruitment software, platforms and services of third-party providers in compliance with legal requirements.

Applicants&#8217; data will also be deleted if an application is withdrawn, to which applicants are entitled at any time. Subject to a justified revocation by the applicant, the deletion will take place at the latest after the expiry of a period of six months, so that we can answer any follow-up questions regarding the application and comply with our duty of proof under the regulations on equal treatment of applicants.

Cloud service providers also process usage data and metadata that they use for security and service optimization purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If we use cloud services to provide documents and content to other users or publicly accessible websites, forms, etc., providers may store cookies on users&#8217; devices for web analysis or to remember user settings (e.g. in the case of media control).<\/p>\n<ul class=\"m-elements\">\n<li><strong>Processed data types:<\/strong> Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); Contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers); Content data (e.g. text input, photographs, videos); Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times). Meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, time information, identification numbers, consent status).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Data subjects:<\/strong> Customers; Employees (e.g. Employees, job applicants); Prospective customers.

Insofar as the contents of the newsletter are specifically described within the framework of registration, they are decisive for the consent of the user. Otherwise, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.<\/p>\n<p>In order to subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to enter your e-mail address. We may, however, ask you to provide a name for the purpose of contacting you personally in the newsletter or to provide further information if this is required for the purposes of the newsletter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Double opt-in procedure:<\/strong> The registration to our newsletter takes place in general in a so-called Double-Opt-In procedure. This means that you will receive an e-mail after registration asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with external e-mail addresses.<\/p>\n<p>The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes storing the login and confirmation times as well as the IP address. Likewise the changes of your data stored with the dispatch service provider are logged.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Deletion and restriction of processing:<\/strong> We may store the unsubscribed email addresses for up to three years based on our legitimate interests before deleting them to provide evidence of prior consent. The processing of these data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual deletion request is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of a consent is confirmed at the same time. In the case of an obligation to permanently observe an objection, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address solely for this purpose in a blocklist.<\/p>\n<p>The logging of the registration process takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of proving its proper course. If we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure sending system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Contents:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Information about us, our services, promotions and offers.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"m-elements\">\n<li><strong>Processed data types:<\/strong> Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); Contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers); Meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, time information, identification numbers, consent status).

You will find a link to cancel the newsletter either at the end of each newsletter or you can otherwise use one of the contact options listed above, preferably e-mail.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Further information on processing methods, procedures and services used:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul class=\"m-elements\">\n<li><strong>Measurement of opening rates and click rates: <\/strong>The newsletters contain a so-called &#8220;web-beacon&#8221;, i.e. a pixel-sized file, which is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened or, if we use a mailing service provider, from its server. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval are first collected.\n<p>This information is used for the technical improvement of our newsletter on the basis of technical data or target groups and their reading behaviour on the basis of their retrieval points (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or access times. This analysis also includes determining whether newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. This information is assigned to the individual newsletter recipients and stored in their profiles until the profiles are deleted. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.<\/p>\n<p>The measurement of opening rates and click rates as well as the storage of the measurement results in the profiles of the users and their further processing are based on the consent of the users.<\/p>\n<p>A separate objection to the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled or objected to. In this case, the stored profile information will be deleted;<br \/>\n<span class=\"\"><strong>Legal Basis:<\/strong> Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"m638\">Commercial communication by E-Mail, Postal Mail, Fax or Telephone<\/h2>\n<p>We process personal data for the purposes of promotional communication, which may be carried out via various channels, such as e-mail, telephone, post or fax, in accordance with the legal requirements.<\/p>\n<p>The recipients have the right to withdraw their consent at any time or to object to the advertising communication at any time.<\/p>\n<p>After revocation or objection, we store the data required to prove the past authorization to contact or send up to three years from the end of the year of revocation or objection on the basis of our legitimate interests. The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. Based on the legitimate interest to permanently observe the revocation, respectively objection of the users, we further store the data necessary to avoid a renewed contact (e.g. depending on the communication channel, the e-mail address, telephone number, name).<\/p>\n<ul class=\"m-elements\">\n<li><strong>Processed data types:<\/strong> Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses).

This may entail risks for users, e.g. by making it more difficult to enforce users&#8217; rights.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created on the basis of user behaviour and the associated interests of users. The user profiles can then be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks which are presumed to correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the user&#8217;s computer, in which the user&#8217;s usage behaviour and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective networks or will become members later on).<\/p>\n<p>For a detailed description of the respective processing operations and the opt-out options, please refer to the respective data protection declarations and information provided by the providers of the respective networks.<\/p>\n<p>Also in the case of requests for information and the exercise of rights of data subjects, we point out that these can be most effectively pursued with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information. If you still need help, please do not hesitate to contact us.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"m-elements\">\n<li><strong>Processed data types:<\/strong> Contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers); Content data (e.g. text input, photographs, videos); Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times).
